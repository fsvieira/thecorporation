# The Corporation
** THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS **

It's your first job, will you get it? Of course you are the best at doing things, but what a day at the office will be like. How are you going to get along with colleagues and the boss? What kind of person are you and will you become after experiencing the rise of power and profit?


# Game Engine

I am using the open source [Monogatari](https://monogatari.io/) visual novel engine: "Built for the modern web, making it easy to create and distribute visual novels that anyone can play pretty much anywhere!"

# Goals
   
    * contribute to [Monogatari](https://github.com/Monogatari/Monogatari/),
    * contribute to [Opengameart](https://opengameart.org/users/fsvieira),
    * and make a fun game/story and have lots of fun doing it.

# Art 
 All of my artwork will be CC0 license, this would be all drawings. I will also put it on opengame art as soon as possible.
